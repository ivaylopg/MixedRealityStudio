# TECH 1711 - Mixed Reality Studio
Section Name: TECH.1711
08/21/2017 - 12/08/2017    
Monday & Wednesday 9:30AM - 12:00pm    
Classroom: M209    
Instructor: Ivaylo Getov - ivaylo.getov@woodbury.edu    

---


This class will explore various platforms for the design and creation of AR and VR applications. Emphasizing hands-on experimentation, this experiential studio is meant to be a collaboration between both programmers and designers to research and develop new paradigms for user experience and new pipelines for the creation of 3D content. Using the Unity game engine and various hardware equipment, such as the Microsoft Hololens, HTC Vive, and mobile devices, students will work individually and in teams to practically apply novel design principles, culminating in a semester project demonstrating a critical approach to designing for these emerging forms of media.

**This Monday-Wednesday class will be substituted for a Saturday 5-hours class up to three times during the semester. Dates TBD.**

### Class Format
Mixed Reality is a rapidly evolving field, both professionally and pedagogically. Encompassing VR, AR, and any number of trendy buzzwords such as "experiential" and immersive, it stretches across disciplines and can be informed by a variety of expertise. I want to create an environment where you can experiment with new techniques and practices, which are themselves in constant flux as the technology changes and finds its audience. 

The class will be structured as a hands-on lab - lectures will serve to introduce or explore concepts that are then put to the test. 

The first session each week (Monday) will tend to be more theoretical, while the second (Wednesday) will dive deeper into execution, coding, and implementation.

We will be on our feet. We will move fast and break things so that we learn how to fix them. We may venture outside and get our hands dirty. You will be asked to split into groups - others may be relying on you to complete a portion of a larger project and it will be your responsibility to deliver.

This course itself is relatively new - the schedule below is tentative and will _very likely_ change over the first couple weeks. Please check this git repository each week to find the most up to date schedule and topics.

### Reading and Course Notes
This course will not have an assigned textbook. Rather, students are required to read or watch additional material as assigned each session. We will be leaning heavily on participation and discussion in this course, and these readings will help get a better intuition and deeper understanding into relevant topics.

All presentation materials, notes, and referenced texts will be made available via this git repository as soon as possible after each session.

### Outcomes
Participants will show proficiency in the following student learning outcomes.

1. Develop understanding of Mixed Reality design and development concept and practices
2. Develop familiarity with a cross-section of Mixed Reality hardware.
3. Develop proficiency designing for experience and space rather than pixels.
4. Complete hands-on exercises and projects to demonstrate familiarity with concepts of Mixed Reality.

### Content
The following course content will be covered.

1. Introduction to the Unity game engine.
2. Introduction to C# Programming
3. Introduction to “Creative Coding”
4. Intro to simulated Physics
5. The history of Virtual/Augmented/Mixed Reality.
6. Differences between Augmented/Mixed/Virtual Reality.
7. Designing for space instead of screens.
8. Hands-on work with Microsoft Hololens, HTC Vive, and Apple iOS/ARKit
9. Basic User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) design.
10. Introduction to project design/organization methods (MVP, Agile, Double-Diamond, etc.)

### Assessment
Students will be evaluated based on the following criteria.

1. Active and verbal participation in in-class discussion to demonstrate completion and understanding of assigned reading.
2. Careful attention to execution, technique and completion of projects
3. Personal challenge and effort in project development
4. Deadline compliance
5. Performance in student learning outcomes

### Grading
Your final grade will be made up from:

* Participation, attendance, in-class projects/exercises: 60%
* Midterm project: 15%
* Final project: 25%

### Guidelines and Policies
Please review the official department guidelines and policies on the [printed syllabus](https://github.com/ivaylopg/MixedRealityStudio/blob/master/SyllabusTech1711.pdf).

## Coding Resources
* [Hello Unity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bPQ9L0hvXM&list=PL64OnOdZ_3NGD4qvRucx7BpKUZ-IqGc0Q) is a great place to start that would specifically help you in _this_ class. He covers a good intro to Unity as well as coding in general.
* One of my favorite general learn-to-code resources is anything by [Daniel Shiffman](https://vimeo.com/shiffman/collections) at NYU. He has a series of videos called [Computer Programming for the Total Beginner](https://vimeo.com/channels/introcompmedia), but once you've got the very very basics down (what are variables? what are functions?) I would highly recommend his video series [The Nature of Code: Simulating Natural Systems with Processing](https://vimeo.com/channels/natureofcode).
* Harvard's intro to CS class is available via HarvardX and youtube: [Harvard CS50 2012](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhQjrBD2T3827MXcOrlJChW2B-gIH81Lx) or [CS50 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4SGkB_8fFs&list=PLhQjrBD2T382VRUw5ZpSxQSFrxMOdFObl)
