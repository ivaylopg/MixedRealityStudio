# Session 03 - 01/21/20

## Introducing `C#`
### Learning a new programming language doesn't always have to be like starting over
* `C#` and `JavaScript` both have "C-Like" syntax:
    * `{` and `}` to define blocks of scope
    * functions defined with `(` and `)`, optionally with parameters passed inside
    * `;` at end of expressions
    * whitespace doesn't (usually) matter
    * `if`, `else`, `while`, `for`, `switch` and many other basic logical constructs work exactly the same
* Even when syntax is different...
    * Python
        * no `{`, or `}`
        * whitespace matters
    * Haskell
        * "declarative" language
    * BrainFuck
        * ????
* ...it doesn't change the fact that programming is **how you think about the problem**.
    * APIs change over time - by the time you've memorized it, the definition changes
        * For example: Unity recently unified all `AR` and `VR` classes into a single `XR` name space
    * Looking up the API isn't "cheating"
        * [Unity Scripting Reference](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/index.html)
            * Look under `UnityEngine > Classes`
        * Most frustrating thing about learning new language is not knowing what's already there for you.


### `C#` vs `JavaScript`
* Most immediate difference you'll notice is that `C#` is **statically typed** while `JavaScript` is **dynamically typed**
    * variables start off as a specific thing, and have to stay that way.
    * Unlike `JavaScript` where you can do `var x = 12` and then later say `x = "hello"`
* This means we have to be a little more specific when we do things in `C#`
* Basic Programming Concepts in `C#`
    * variables
        * "Primitive" types like `int`, `float`, `bool`
        * Also "instances" of more complex types like `Vector3`,
        * Can _cast_ into other types with `()`
            * `int myInt = 4;`
            * `float myFloat = 25.0f;`
            * `int myOtherInt = myInt / (int) myFloat;`
    * functions
        * passing parameters
            * overloading (3 floats vs a `Vector3`)
        * "returning" a value
    * scope (inside of `{` and `}`)
    * operations and assignment (from function)
    * The `.` operator
        * `Random.Range`


### `C#` in Unity
* Scripts must be placed in hierarchy to become active
    * Multiple copies of scripts act independently
* File name and Class name **must be the same**
* `Debug.Log()` **is your friend!**
* `public` vs `private`
* Working with **Components** in your scripts
    * `GameObject` vs `gameObject`
    * `GetCompnent<>()` vs `GetComponent()`
        * The `<>` represent generic `Type`
        * You (the programmer) indicate type at runtime and the returned object immediately is cast correctly.
        * This means you can do something like this:
            * `gameObject.GetComponent<Rigidbody>().useGravity;`
            * i.e. access the `useGravity property right away
        * Alternatively, the non-generic version requires you to know the String name of the component
            * `gameObject.GetComponent("Rigidbody");`
            * Prone to misspellings & does not benefit from autocorrect;
            * Cannot access properties (i.e. `useGravity`) until assigned to correct variable type
            * Therefore I suggest not to use
* The `Input` class
    * Used to capture mouse/keyboard/gamepad input
